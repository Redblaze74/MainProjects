# AI 15-Puzzle Solver
This is a C++ Program that involves using A* Search to solve an integer vector of 16 states. 

Currently there are 3 puzzles in the program and to solve any one of them change the variable 'choice' in main.cpp.
* Spiral
* Backwards
* Simple

## Compile and Run
Please use "g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp astarsolver.cpp -o puzzle_solver" and "./puzzle_solver" to get an output of the nodes generated, length of the solution path, and the solution path for the problem.

Feel free to include any of your own 15-puzzles that are solveable in the program.
