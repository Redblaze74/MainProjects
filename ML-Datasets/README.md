# Classification and Linear Regression Algorithms
This lists three programs that solve binary classification problems and a regression problem.

## Classification
Both of my classification programs, 'nbc.py' and 'logreg.py' use the same dataset, 'emails.csv'. They both detected keywords, the length of the email, and detected how many hyperlinks were included in the email.

- 'nbc.py' - Implemented Naive Bayes Classifier
- 'logreg.py' - Implemented Logistic Regression

## Regression
Here linreg.py is my program used to estimate the cost of housing based on the area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and number of stories of the house.

- Implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Implemented Linear regression with gradient descent
